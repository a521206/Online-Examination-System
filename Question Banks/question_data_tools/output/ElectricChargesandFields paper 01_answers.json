    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "The SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb, which is equivalent to about $6.242\\times10^{-19}$ e (e is the charge of a proton). Hence, the charge of an electron is approximately $-1.602\\times10^{-19}$ C. The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the cross section of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere within one second. The symbol Q is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge."
