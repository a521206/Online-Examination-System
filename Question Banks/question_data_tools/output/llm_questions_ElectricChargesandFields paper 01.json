    "solution": "The correct answer is option C because the force of electrostatic repulsion between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law, which states \\( F = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\), where \\( F \\) is the force, \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges on spheres A and B, and \\( r \\) is the distance between their centers.
