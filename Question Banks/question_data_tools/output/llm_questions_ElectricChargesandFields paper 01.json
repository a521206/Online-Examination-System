    "optionB": "ohm",
    "optionC": "coulomb",
    "optionD": "ampere",
    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "The SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb, which is equivalent to about $6.242\\times10^{-19}$ e (e is the charge of a proton). Hence, the charge of an electron is approximately $-1.602\\times10^{-19}$ C. The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the cross section of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere within one second. The symbol Q is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge.",

    "optionD": "a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude $q$ separated by a distance $d",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "An electric dipole is a separation of positive and negative charges. The simplest example of this is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by some (usually small) distance. A permanent electric dipole is called an electret.",
