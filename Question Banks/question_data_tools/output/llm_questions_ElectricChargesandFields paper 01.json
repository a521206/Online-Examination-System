    "optionB": "$\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}$",
    "optionC": "$\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$",
    "optionD": "$\\frac{Q}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}$",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "Electric field due to hollow sphere or thin spherical shell: Let a spherical conductor of radius $R$ and a charge $q$ is distributed uniformly over it. At external pointâ€”The charge at the surface of radius $r$ is $q$ the effect of their charge is also spherical, let the Gaussian surface is of radius $r$, let a small element on the surface whose area vector is $dS$ and electric field is $E$. But by Gauss theorem $\\oint E \\cdot dS = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}$ so $E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}$.",

    "optionB": "ohm",
    "optionC": "coulomb",
    "optionD": "ampere",
    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "The SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb, which is equivalent to about $6.242\\times10^{18} e$ (e is the charge of a proton). Hence, the charge of an electron is approximately $-1.602\\times10^{-19} C$. The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the cross section of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere within one second. The symbol $Q$ is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge.",
